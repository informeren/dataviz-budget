=head1 NAME

sunburst.pl - Convert CSV files to JSON files for use with D3

=head1 SYNOPSIS

sunburst.pl -i INPUT_FILE -o OUTPUT_FILE [-l LEVELS] [-e EXCLUDE]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script lets you convert a CSV report from http://www.oes-cs.dk/ to a hierarchical data structure in JSON format for use with libraries like D3.

=head2 Command-Line Options

The following invocation of the command reads the file "2014.csv" and exports the first 3 levels of the hierarchy to "2014.json", ignoring the accounts 42, 420, and 421.

    sunburst.pl -i 2014.csv -o 2014.json -l 3 -e 42,420,421

=over

=item -i INPUT_FILE

The absolute or relative path to the input file. This file should contain the raw output which you downloaded from the report generator on http://www.oes-cs.dk/.

=item -o OUTPUT_FILE

The absolute or relative path to the output file. This file will be in JSON format.

=item -l LEVELS

The number of level to include in the output file. If you have made a full report, setting the level to 2 will only output the levels "Paragraf" and "HovedomrÃ¥de". This argument is optional.

=item -e EXCLUDE

A comma-separated list of account numbers to exclude from the generated file. This argument is optional.

=head2 Data Structures

The @amounts array contains the following values (when looking at data for 2014):

   * R 2012 (report)
   * B 2013 (budget)
   * F 2014 (appropriation)
   * BO 2015
   * BO 2016
   * BO 2017

See the help section on http://www.oes-cs.dk/olapdatabase/finanslov/index.cgi for more information on the available data.
